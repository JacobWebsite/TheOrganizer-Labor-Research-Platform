# Union per-capita rates: The key to estimating membership from Form 990 data

Understanding how dues revenue flows between local, state, and national union levels is essential for converting IRS Form 990 revenue into accurate membership estimates. The critical insight: **per-capita rates vary dramatically by union type and organizational level**—from just $11.50/year for FOP Grand Lodge to $251/year for AFSCME International. This report provides the exact rates needed for Form 990 membership calculations.

## The fundamental formula for membership estimation

When analyzing a union's Form 990 dues revenue, the calculation depends entirely on which organizational level you're examining:

**For national/international unions:** Membership = Total Dues Revenue ÷ National Per-Capita Rate

**For state affiliates:** Membership = (State Portion of Revenue) ÷ State Per-Capita Rate

**For locals:** Membership = Total Dues Revenue ÷ (Local + State + National rates combined)

The tables below provide the exact per-capita figures needed for each major public sector union.

## Teachers unions: NEA and AFT per-capita structures

The NEA and AFT operate fundamentally different models that affect Form 990 interpretation. NEA uses a formula-based per-capita tied to **0.28% of national average teacher salary**, while AFT sets flat monthly rates through constitutional amendments.

### NEA national per-capita rates (2024-2025)

| Member Category | Annual Per-Capita to NEA National |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Active Professional (full-time) | **$213.00** |
| Active Professional (part-time 26-50%) | $118.00 |
| Active Professional (≤25%/substitute) | $70.75 |
| Education Support Professional (full-time) | **$126.50** |
| ESP (part-time) | $75.00 |
| Retired Professional | $35.00 |
| Retired ESP | $21.00 |
| Student/Aspiring Educator | $15.00 |

The **2025-2026 rate increases to $219** for full-time professionals, reflecting the salary formula adjustment. NEA's per-capita includes $20 for ballot measures, $1 for the NEA Foundation, and $3 for affiliate assistance funds built into the base rate.

### AFT national per-capita rates (effective September 2024)

| Member Category | Monthly Rate | Annual Rate |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Full-dues payer | $20.18 | **$242.16** |
| Half-dues (<$34,000 salary or <50% FTE) | $10.09 | $121.08 |
| Quarter-dues (<$14,000 salary) | $5.04 | $60.48 |
| Eighth-dues (<$8,500 salary) | $2.52 | $30.24 |
| Laid-off/unpaid leave | $1.00 | $12.00 |

AFT's per-capita is **$23 higher annually** than NEA's equivalent rate. The $20.18 monthly rate includes allocations of $1.25 to local assistance, $2.80 to the Solidarity Fund for political activities, $1.00 to the Militancy/Defense Fund, and $0.20 rebated to state federations.

### State teacher affiliate dues breakdown

State affiliates retain the majority of dues revenue, with only **15-26% flowing to NEA national**. This breakdown is critical for interpreting state-level Form 990s:

| State Affiliate | Total Annual Dues | State Portion | NEA Portion | State Retains |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **NJEA** (New Jersey) | $1,400-1,500 | ~$999-1,127 | ~$200 | **70%** |
| **CTA** (California) | $1,200-1,400 | $816-858 | $213-219 | **79%** |
| **PSEA** (Pennsylvania) | $700-1,000 | ~$542 | ~$200 | **74%** |
| **NYSUT** (New York)* | $700-1,400 | ~$378 | Split AFT/NEA | **70%** |
| **OEA** (Ohio) | ~$800 | $577 | ~$219 | **73%** |
| **MEA** (Michigan) | $900-1,000 | $655 max | $219 | **75%** |
| **IEA** (Illinois) | $600-900 | Graduated | $204 | ~**70%** |
| **FEA** (Florida)* | $700-900 | ~$503 max | Both AFT+NEA | **56%** |
| **TSTA** (Texas) | $600-800 | ~$350-400 | ~$219 | ~**65%** |

*Dual AFT/NEA affiliates pay per-capita to both national unions.

**For Form 990 analysis of state affiliates**: The state affiliate's dues revenue represents primarily the state portion plus pass-through of NEA/AFT per-capita. To estimate membership, divide state dues revenue by the state per-capita rate (not total member dues), since locals collect and remit separately.

### Major AFT locals for Form 990 estimation

**United Federation of Teachers (UFT - NYC)**: Members pay **0.85% of Step 8B+L20 salary** plus $10.89/month AFT/NYSUT pass-through. Total annual dues approximately **$1,050**. UFT remits approximately **$130-140/year per member** to affiliates (AFT + NYSUT + AFL-CIO combined). On UFT's Form 990, divide affiliate remittance revenue by ~$135 for membership estimate.

**Chicago Teachers Union (CTU)**: Members pay **1% of Lane 1, Step 6 compensation**. Total approximately **$1,400/year**. CTU keeps ~$750 as base dues; remainder flows to IFT (state) and AFT (national). For CTU's Form 990, use ~$750/member for the local portion.

## Police unions: FOP's low per-capita vs PBA independence

Police union structures produce dramatically different Form 990 interpretations due to FOP's minimal national per-capita versus PBA organizations' complete independence.

### FOP Grand Lodge national per-capita (confirmed)

| Component | Annual Rate |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Grand Lodge national per-capita** | **$11.50** |
| Payment schedule | $5.75 semi-annually |
| 2024 approved increase | +$6.00 over 5 years |

This **remarkably low $11.50/year national per-capita** means FOP Grand Lodge Form 990 dues revenue represents massive membership numbers. Dividing Grand Lodge dues revenue by $11.50 yields total affiliated membership.

### State FOP per-capita rates

| State Lodge | State Per-Capita | + National | Total State+National |
|-------------|------------------|------------|---------------------|
| Michigan | $25.00/year | $11.50 | **$36.50** |
| Minnesota | $14.95/year | $11.50 | **$26.45** |
| Other states | ~$15-25/year | $11.50 | **$26-37** estimated |

### Local FOP lodge dues ranges

Local FOP lodges show extreme variation based on bargaining status and benefits:

| Lodge Type | Annual Dues Range |
|------------|-------------------|
| Fraternal-only lodges | $35-75 |
| Bargaining unit lodges | $100-300 |
| With legal defense plans | $150-300+ |
| Corrections lodges | Up to $300 |

**Sample breakdown (Minnesota Lodge 1)**: Total $40/year member dues splits to state ($14.95), national ($11.50), and local retention ($13.55). The local keeps only **34%** of dues.

### Police Benevolent Associations have no national per-capita

PBAs operate as **independent organizations with no hierarchical national structure**. This fundamentally changes Form 990 analysis:

**NYC PBA**: Approximately **$936/year** ($36/biweekly paycheck) including vision, dental, and annuity contributions. **100% stays with NYC PBA**—no remittance to any national body. For NYC PBA Form 990, divide total dues revenue by ~$936.

**New Jersey State PBA**: Federated structure with 407 chapters and ~50,000 members. Locals remit per-capita to state organization. NJ PBA Retired Officers Local 600 charges $65/year.

**Florida PBA**: Semi-autonomous county/regional charters. No standardized national per-capita; dues vary by local chapter.

## Firefighter unions: IAFF's tiered international per-capita

IAFF operates a clear hierarchical structure with defined per-capita rates that adjust annually by CPI (capped between 1.5-3.5% increases).

### IAFF international per-capita rates (2024-2025)

| Member Category | Monthly | Annual |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| **Active members** | $15.20 | **~$182.40** |
| Retired-active members | $7.60 | ~$91.20 |

The 2022 IAFF Convention adopted resolutions raising per-capita to approximately **$16.73/month ($200.76/year)** including allocations for cancer research (+9.5¢), IAFF Foundation (+29.5¢), and Emergency Disputes Fund (+7.5¢).

### State firefighter association per-capita

| State Association | Monthly Per-Capita |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Michigan (MPFFU)** | $18.42 |
| **Washington (WSCFF)** | $13.03 |
| California (CPF) | Not disclosed (COLA ≤5%/year) |
| Illinois (AFFI) | Capped at 500 members/local |

Michigan's rate includes specific allocations: $0.50 legal defense, $0.25 behavioral health, $0.40 contract analyst program.

### Complete IAFF local dues breakdown example

**IAFF Local 31 (Tacoma, WA)** provides full transparency on dues flow:

| Recipient | Monthly Amount | Annual |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Local 31 operations | $43.32 | $519.84 |
| Washington State Council | $13.03 | $156.36 |
| IAFF International | $9.95* | $119.40* |
| Pierce County Labor Council | $0.50 | $6.00 |
| **Total from $67.64 union dues** | $67.64 | $811.68 |

*2018 figure; current IAFF rate is $15.20+/month

For IAFF International's Form 990, use **~$182-200/member** to estimate affiliated membership from dues revenue.

### NYC firefighter unions are IAFF-affiliated

Both major FDNY unions maintain IAFF affiliation and remit international per-capita:
- **UFA (Local 94)**: ~9,000 active members, IAFF-affiliated since 1995
- **UFOA (Local 854)**: ~1,500 officers, IAFF-affiliated since founding

## AFSCME and SEIU: Different models, different calculations

These two major public sector unions use fundamentally different dues structures—AFSCME emphasizes flat-rate minimums while SEIU uses percentage-of-salary models.

### AFSCME international per-capita

**Current rate**: Approximately **$251.40/year (~$20.95/month)** remitted to AFSCME International.

AFSCME's constitutional formula allocates dues increases as:
- **30%** to International
- **60%** to councils
- **10%** to locals

For councils not affiliated with locals: 70% to council, 30% to International.

### AFSCME council per-capita rates

| Council | Monthly Per-Capita | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| **Council 36** (Southern California) | $33.85 full-time | $25.40 part-time |
| **Council 31** (Illinois) | Up to $53 | Average $429/year |
| **Council 93** (Massachusetts) | $5.00 + constitutional | Increased from $2.50 |
| **DC 37** (NYC) | Variable | $390-1,885/year range |
| **Oregon Council 75** | 1.27% of salary | $22.95-90.25/month |

For AFSCME International's Form 990, divide per-capita revenue by **~$251** to estimate affiliated membership.

### SEIU international per-capita

| Component | Monthly | Annual |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Base per-capita | $7.65 | $91.80 |
| Unity Fund | $5.00 | $60.00 |
| **Total to International** | **$12.65** | **$151.80** |

SEIU sets **minimum dues of $35/month** through its constitution.

### SEIU Local 1000 (California state employees) breakdown

- **Dues rate**: 1.5% of gross salary, capped at $90/month
- **Average member**: ~$1,000/year
- **Approximate allocation**: ~20% of budget to SEIU International

For SEIU International's Form 990, divide affiliate remittances by **~$152** for membership estimate.

## Quick reference: National per-capita rates for Form 990 analysis

| Union | National Annual Per-Capita | Form 990 Calculation |
|-------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **NEA** | $213-219 (professional) | Dues ÷ $216 avg |
| **AFT** | $242.16 | Dues ÷ $242 |
| **FOP Grand Lodge** | $11.50 | Dues ÷ $11.50 |
| **IAFF** | $182-200 | Dues ÷ $190 avg |
| **AFSCME** | $251.40 | Dues ÷ $251 |
| **SEIU** | $151.80 | Dues ÷ $152 |
| **PBA** | N/A (no national) | Local-specific |

## Methodology notes and data quality

These rates derive from official union constitutions, bylaws, published dues schedules, and convention resolutions. State-level figures come from state affiliate websites and labor relations filings. Several important caveats apply:

**Member category mix matters**: Using the full-time professional rate overstates membership if significant retired, part-time, or ESP members exist. NEA's ESP rate ($126.50) is 41% lower than the professional rate.

**Annual adjustments**: NEA ties per-capita to average teacher salary; IAFF uses CPI-based COLA (1.5-3.5% annually); AFSCME adjusts by member wage increases. Rates published here are 2024-2025 unless noted.

**Dual affiliates**: FEA (Florida), NYSUT (New York), and three other states pay per-capita to both NEA and AFT, complicating Form 990 interpretation for these organizations.

**LM-2 vs Form 990**: Unions filing LM-2 reports with the Department of Labor provide detailed per-capita breakdowns that can validate Form 990-derived estimates.

## Conclusion: Practical application for membership estimation

The per-capita rates in this report enable direct conversion of Form 990 dues revenue to membership estimates with reasonable accuracy. For national unions, the calculation is straightforward: divide dues revenue by the applicable per-capita rate. For state affiliates, remember that 70-80% of dues revenue represents the state portion, with only 15-26% flowing to national organizations.

The most significant finding for practical application is the **extreme variation across union types**: FOP's $11.50 national per-capita is 21 times lower than AFSCME's $251.40 rate. This means identical Form 990 dues figures represent vastly different membership sizes depending on union type. Always match the per-capita rate to the specific organizational level and union family being analyzed.
