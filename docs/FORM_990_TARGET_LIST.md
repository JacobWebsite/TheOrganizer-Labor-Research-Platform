# Form 990 Target List: Public Sector Gap Organizations
## Priority Organizations for Membership Estimation

---

## Overview

This document identifies Form 990-filing organizations that can help fill public sector gaps in the OLMS-based platform. Organizations are prioritized by:
1. Size (estimated membership)
2. State gap severity
3. Data availability

---

## Tier 1: State Education Associations (NEA Affiliates)

**Why priority:** NEA affiliates represent ~3 million members nationally, none of whom file LM reports with OLMS.

| State | Organization | Est. Members | EIN | Dues/Yr | Priority |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----|---------|----------|
| **CA** | California Teachers Association (CTA) | 309,000 | **94-0362310** ✓ | $737 | CRITICAL |
| **NY** | New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) | 600,000+ | 16-0899580 | ~$600 | CRITICAL |
| **TX** | Texas State Teachers Association (TSTA) | 60,000 | 74-1109755 | ~$450 | HIGH |

| **OK** | Oklahoma Education Association | 35,000 | **73-0384310** ✓ | ~$520 | COMPLETE ✓ |

**Note:** ✓ = EIN verified via ProPublica; Dues/Yr estimates are total unified (NEA+state+local)

**Data needs:** 
- Dues rate schedules (state portion only)
- Member category breakdowns
- Historical 990s (2015-2024)

---

## Tier 2: AFT State Federations

**Why priority:** AFT state federations are separate from NEA but also exempt from LMRDA.

| State | Organization | Est. Members | EIN | Priority |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----|----------|
| **NY** | NY State United Teachers (merged) | See NYSUT | | CRITICAL |
| **CA** | CFT (CA Federation of Teachers) | 120,000 | 94-1156568 | HIGH |

| **MI** | MI Federation of Teachers | 35,000 | 38-1721746 | MEDIUM |
| **OH** | OH Federation of Teachers | 20,000 | 31-0537591 | MEDIUM |
| **WA** | WA Federation of Teachers | 8,000 | 91-0633870 | LOW |

**Note:** Some states have merged NEA/AFT affiliates (NYSUT, Education Minnesota, FEA). Check for dual-affiliation to avoid double-counting.

---

## Tier 3: Fraternal Order of Police (FOP)

**Why priority:** FOP is the largest police labor organization (~373,000 members nationally) but most state/local lodges don't file LM reports.

### National/Major State Lodges

| State | Organization | Est. Members | EIN | Priority |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----|----------|
| **National** | Grand Lodge FOP | 373,000* | 36-2166860 | REFERENCE |
| **PA** | PA State Lodge FOP | 40,000 | 23-1660186 | HIGH |
| **OH** | Ohio FOP | 25,000 | 31-0953690 | HIGH |
| **FL** | Florida State Lodge FOP | 22,000 | 59-1274180 | HIGH |
| **TX** | Texas State Lodge FOP | 20,000 | 74-1720960 | HIGH |
| **NJ** | NJ State Lodge FOP | 35,000 | 22-1863891 | HIGH |
| **IL** | Illinois FOP | 35,000 | 36-2586787 | HIGH |
| **NY** | NY State Lodge FOP | 15,000 | 14-1584750 | MEDIUM |
| **CA** | CA State Lodge FOP | 10,000 | 94-2489930 | MEDIUM |
| **MI** | Michigan FOP | 12,000 | 38-1684140 | MEDIUM |
| **IN** | Indiana FOP | 12,000 | 35-0968800 | MEDIUM |

*Grand Lodge total may include some LM-filing locals

**Data needs:**
- State lodge vs. local lodge delineation
- Avoid double-counting with municipal police locals that DO file LM reports

---

## Tier 4: State Employee Associations (Non-AFSCME)

**Why priority:** Many states have independent state employee associations separate from AFSCME.

| State | Organization | Est. Members | EIN | Priority |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----|----------|
| **CA** | CSEA (CA State Employees Assn) | 140,000 | 94-0409830 | CRITICAL |
| **TX** | Texas State Employees Union | 20,000 | 74-2323840 | HIGH |
| **NY** | Civil Service Employees Assn (CSEA) | 300,000 | 14-1334740 | CRITICAL |

| **NC** | State Employees Assn of NC (SEANC) | 55,000 | 56-0529060 | HIGH |
| **GA** | GA State Employees Union | 5,000 | TBD | LOW |

| **OR** | Oregon AFSCME | LM-filer | | SKIP |
| **WA** | WFSE (WA Fed of State Employees) | 50,000 | 91-0565650 | HIGH |

**Note:** Some "state employee associations" are actually AFSCME locals/councils and DO file LM reports. Verify before pulling 990.

## Tier 5: State/Regional Fire Fighter Associations

**Why priority:** IAFF files LM reports for many locals, but state associations and independent locals may not.

| State | Organization | Est. Members | EIN | Priority |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----|----------|
| **CA** | CA Professional Firefighters | 30,000 | 94-1156720 | HIGH |
| **TX** | TX State Assn of Fire Fighters | 18,000 | 74-1109900 | MEDIUM |

| **OH** | Ohio Assn of Professional FF | 10,000 | 31-0537650 | LOW |

**Note:** Cross-reference with IAFF LM data to avoid double-counting.

| **Multi** | AAUP (national) | 47,000 | 53-0196617 | REFERENCE |
