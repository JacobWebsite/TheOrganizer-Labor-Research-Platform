This is an excellent and thorough proposal. The proposed changes correctly identify the major weaknesses of the current system and move towards a more robust, evidence-based architecture. Here is a review covering the questions you raised:

### 1. Performance Analysis
The "best-match-wins" approach is computationally more expensive, but the impact should be manageable and is a worthwhile trade-off for accuracy.

*   **Exact Tiers:** The first 3-4 tiers (EIN, name+city+state, etc.) rely on in-memory dictionary lookups. Even with 868K records, iterating through 4 hashmap lookups per record will be extremely fast, likely taking only a few seconds. **This part of the slowdown is negligible.**
*   **Fuzzy Tier (Splink):** This is the main performance consideration. Running Splink on all 868K records against 146K targets would be too slow for a routine process.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement a hybrid "best-match" strategy.
    1.  Run all the exact-match tiers for a given record.
    2.  Find the best score among them.
    3.  **Only if the best exact-match score is below a defined threshold** (e.g., less than 90, the score for `name+city+state`), pass the record to Splink for fuzzy matching.

This focuses the expensive fuzzy matching only on the records that are hardest to place, while still ensuring you find the best possible match for every record.

### 2. Multi-Value Index Disambiguation
This is a critical improvement. When a key (e.g., `name+state`) maps to multiple F7 employers, you have a list of candidates. Trying to build a complex secondary scoring system here is brittle.

*   **Recommendation:** Use the multi-value index to generate candidates, and **use Splink to disambiguate.**
    1.  An OSHA record for "Hospitality Services" in "CA" matches a key that returns a list of candidates from the multi-value index.
    2.  Instead of comparing the OSHA record to all 146K F7 employers, you run Splink's `predict()` method comparing the source record against only those candidates.
    3.  This is computationally cheap and leverages Splink's core strength: weighing multiple fields (`city`, `zip`, `address`, etc.) to find the most probable match from a list of options.
    4.  If the top-scoring candidate from this group is above your Splink confidence threshold, you have a winner. If not, the record remains unmatched.

### 3. Splink Startup and Model Staleness
Your concern about startup time is valid, but it can be fully mitigated.

*   **Recommendation:** **Pre-train the Splink model offline and save it.** The pipeline should not be training the model at runtime.
    1.  **Training:** Perform the EM training once as a separate maintenance task on a representative data sample.
    2.  **Caching:** Save the resulting model parameters to a file (e.g., `splink_model.json`). The `linker.save_model_to_json()` function is designed for this.
    3.  **Loading:** At pipeline startup, load the pre-trained model from the file using `linker.load_model_from_json()`. This is nearly instantaneous.

*   **Model Staleness:** For name and address matching, model parameters are very stable. The underlying patterns of what makes two records a match don't change quickly. You can treat the model like any other software dependency.
    *   **Strategy:** Schedule a model retraining and re-evaluation every 6-12 months, or when you add significant new data sources.

### 4. Confidence Scoring
The goal is a single, comparable confidence score across all tiers. A `base * multiplier` formula is less transparent than a direct probability-based approach.

*   **Recommendation:** Create a unified confidence scale from 0.0 to 1.0.
    *   **Exact Tiers:** Assign high, fixed confidence values. These are heuristics, but they are clear and defensible.
        *   `EIN Exact Match`: **0.99** (Reserve 1.0 for manually verified matches).
        *   `Name + City + State Match`: **0.95**
        *   `Name + State Match`: **0.90**
        *   `Aggressive Name + State Match`: **0.80**
    *   **Splink Tier:** Use the `match_probability` generated by Splink directly as its score. This value is already on a 0.0-1.0 scale and is statistically derived.

This allows for direct, "apples-to-apples" comparison. If a record gets a `Name + State` match (0.90) but Splink finds a match with 0.93 probability, the system correctly identifies the Splink result as the better one.

### 5. Handling Edge Cases (Disagreements)
Disagreements between tiers are not problems; they are valuable signals of data quality issues.

*   **Scenario:** An OSHA record has an EIN match to F7 Employer A, but the names are completely different ("City Services" vs. "Global Tech Inc.").
*   **Current Logic:** Blindly accepts the EIN match.
*   **Proposed Logic:** The EIN match gets a score of 0.99. Splink, seeing the name mismatch, would score it very low, maybe 0.15. The "best-match" logic would still choose the 0.99, which is likely correct.
*   **Recommendation:** Add a "disagreement flag".
    *   After the best match is selected, perform a check: `if best_match_tier == 'EIN' and splink_probability < 0.2:`.
    *   If this condition is met, save the match but add a boolean flag or a note (`flag_ein_name_discrepancy = true`) to the match result row.
    *   This allows you to automatically accept the strong evidence of the EIN while simultaneously flagging the record for a human to review later, as it may indicate a clerical error or a complex corporate ownership change.

### 6. Re-run Strategy
Given the fundamental shift in methodology, an incremental approach is risky and will produce an inconsistent final dataset.

*   **Recommendation:** **Perform a full wipe and re-run.**
    1.  **Archive:** Take a backup of the current `employer_matches` table.
    2.  **Truncate:** Clear the existing match table.
    3.  **Re-run:** Execute the new pipeline from scratch for all data sources (OSHA, WHD, etc.).

This is the only way to establish a new, reliable baseline. It ensures every record is judged by the same superior logic, eliminates legacy errors, and allows you to accurately measure the lift in match rates and quality from the new system. It is a one-time cost for a significant gain in data integrity.
