---METHODOLOGY NOTES---

BENCHMARK SOURCE:
EPI State of Working America Data Library 2024 (CPS-based union membership estimates)
Private sector from union_membership.csv; Public sector from Table 6b (12-month rolling averages)

PLATFORM PRIVATE SECTOR (6.25M methodology):
Source: F-7 Employer Bargaining Notices (OLMS) with reconciliation
Exclusions applied: Federal affiliations (AFGE/APWU/NALC/NFFE/NTEU/AFT), government union names, public employer patterns
Adjustment factors: MATCHED=actual estimate, UNMATCHED=35% of raw, NAME_INFERRED=15% of raw
Known issues: Multi-employer agreements may cause some overcounting; small states under-sampled

PLATFORM PUBLIC SECTOR:
Source: OLMS state/local union filings + FLRA federal bargaining unit worker counts
Known issues: Many states don't file with OLMS (right-to-work, no collective bargaining laws)
DC distortion: National union HQs located in DC inflate numbers massively - always exclude DC for analysis

---FLAG DEFINITIONS---

PRIVATE_OVER: Platform > 115% of EPI - investigate possible double-counting or multi-employer effects
PRIVATE_UNDER: Platform < 65% of EPI - coverage gap, may need additional data sources
PUBLIC_OVER: Platform > 115% of EPI - likely HQ effects or OLMS reporting artifacts
PUBLIC_GAP: Platform < 50% of EPI but some data exists - partial coverage
NO_PUBLIC_DATA: Platform essentially 0% - state doesn't report to OLMS, need state PERB data
HQ_EFFECT: DC-specific distortion from national headquarters

---STATES TO INVESTIGATE---

DOUBLE-COUNTING RISK (Private >130%):
AR (140%), KS (142%), MN (137%), UT (132%)
Check: Multi-employer master agreements, regional council structures

MAJOR PRIVATE GAPS (<50%):
ME (19%), VT (23%), WY (26%), NH (28%), MT (43%)
Check: Small sample sizes, industry composition, data quality

NO PUBLIC SECTOR DATA (10 states):
AL, AR, ID, MS, ND, OK, SC, SD, UT + effectively WY
These states lack collective bargaining for public employees or don't file with OLMS
Future: State PERB databases, individual state open records requests

PUBLIC SECTOR OVERCOUNTED (>115%):
CT (117%), IL (172%), MN (112%), NY (145%), PA (141%), VT (119%)
Check: HQ location effects, multi-local aggregation in filings
